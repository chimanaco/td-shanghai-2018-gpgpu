Hi everyone,

First of all. Thank you very much for joining this workshop.
There is Jimmmz who will translate what I will say and explain more than I say.
If you have question, please feel free to ask us.

We will invite you all to wechat group for this workshop, so you can ask there, too.
You might have question which we can't answer today, but we will make it our homework and post it on the wechat group.

Please download the file we use for this workshop.

Ok Let's get started.
Today we will make GPGPU particle together.

GPGPU which stands for general purpose GPU

> General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU, rarely GPGP) is the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU), which typically handles computation only for computer graphics, to perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the central processing unit (CPU)

In this workshop, we will use GPU to define parameters like position and size which normally calculate in CPU.

If you open up the file,
We will go through particle1 to particle3 and then go to lab time.
We also put some examples for you to use as reference or to get an idea.
